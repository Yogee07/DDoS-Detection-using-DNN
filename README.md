# DDoS-Detection
Classification of DDoS attack packets using Artificial Neural Network and Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network.

## Dataset Used
Used sampled data from [Intrusion detection evaluation dataset (ISCXIDS2012)](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids.html), an attack database that is a standard for judgment of attack detection tools.
